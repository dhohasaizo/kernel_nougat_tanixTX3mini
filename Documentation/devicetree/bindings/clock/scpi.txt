Device Tree Clock bindings for the clocks based on
System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the following:
	"arm,scpi-clks" - for the container node with all the clocks
		based on the SCPI protocol
	"arm,scpi-clk-indexed" - all the clocks that are variable and index
		based. These clocks don't provide the full range between the
		limits but only discrete points within the range. The firmware
		provides the mapping for each such operating frequency and the
		index associated with it.
	"arm,scpi-clk-range" - all the clocks that are variable and provide
		full range within the specified range

Required properties for all clocks(all from common clock binding):
- #clock-cells : ; shall be set to 0 or 1 depending on whether it has single
	or multiple clock outputs.
- clock-output-names : shall be the corresponding names of the outputs.
- clock-indices: The identifyng number for the clocks in the node as expected
	by the firmware. It can be non linear and hence provide the mapping
	of identifiers into the clock-output-names array.
- frequency-range: The allowed range of clock frequency supported specified
	in the form of minimum and maximum limits(two u32 fields)
	This is required only if compatible is "arm,scpi-clk-range"

Clock consumers should specify the desired clocks they use with a
"clocks" phandle cell. Consumers should also provide an additional ID
in their clock property. This ID refers to the specific clock in the clock
provider list.
